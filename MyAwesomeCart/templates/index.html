        <p>In recent years there has been a large variety of e-commerce websites that had popped up. Ecommerce websites have helped both small and big businesses develop and evolve. Ecommerce websites have made it easy for small businesses to grow and expand their boundaries by exporting their goods to distant places. It has also helped consumers who require certain goods and or services. Much like a traditional physical retail store, e-commerce websites allow consumers and businesses to buy and sell to one another on a designated platform. The main difference between e-commerce and physical commerce, however, is that e-commerce transactions occur entirely over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Here in this project, we are going to provide the customer the option to choose or customize their own design on their clothes. The online retail store allows them to shop for the goods online based on their choice and we are going to deliver the final project to the customer. Here we have provided all the options to put our customers at ease while shopping online and make their shop experience easy and simple.â€‹</p>
